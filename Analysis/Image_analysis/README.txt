1. Download Anaconda
2. Import environment into conda:
	Enviroments --> Import --> select environment.yml

3. Open your terminal and type:
    source activate ciha
    cd ../interface
    python gui-segmentation.py


(cd stands for change directory, you would need to navigate to the directory where you saved the interface folder)
